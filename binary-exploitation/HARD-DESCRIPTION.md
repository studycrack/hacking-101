This challenge is identical to its "easy" version from a security perspective, but has the following changes:

1. Unlike the easy version, it does not give you helpful debug output.
   You will have to recover this information using a debugger.
2. The source code is not provided.
   You will need to reverse-engineer the binary, but remember, the challenge is conceptually the same as the easy version, so it can be helpful to have the easy version's source code as a secondary reference during your reversing process!
2. Some randomization is different.
   Buffers might have different lengths, offsets might vary, etc.
   You will need to reverse engineer this information from the binary!
