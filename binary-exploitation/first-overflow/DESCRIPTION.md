This challenge is identical to its "easy" version from a security perspective, but has the following changes:

1. Unlike the easy version, it does not give you helpful debug output.
   You will have to recover this information using a debugger.
2. **For all other "hard" versions**, the source code will not be provided, and you will need to reverse-engineer the binary using your knowledge of the "easy" version as a reference.
   However, for this one challenge, to get you familiar with the differences between the easy and hard versions, we will provide the source code.
2. Some randomization is different.
   Buffers might have different lengths, offsets might vary, etc.
   You will need to reverse engineer this information from the binary!
