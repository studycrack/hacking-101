Computers run an incredible managerie of programs that make modern life possible.
But how do they work, deep down inside?
In this dojo, we will dive into the depths of computation, reach (something close to) its very underpinnings, and strive to understand it all.

This dojo will start with teaching you the underlying machine code that computers process directly.
From there, we will explore additional concepts, gradually solidifying your understanding and preparing you for the rest of pwn.college.

Join us for this journey, and let's learn computing together.
